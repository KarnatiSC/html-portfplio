<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Sharath Chandra, someone who’s endlessly fascinated by the world and how it works. I love diving into new ideas, 
  whether that’s through exploring cutting-edge technology, getting lost in a creative project, 
  or simply chatting about life’s big questions. My background has given me a mix of skills and experiences 
  that I’m always eager to put to use in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>What fuels me is a passion for understanding and connecting with others. I thrive on those moments when a 
  new perspective clicks into place, whether it’s from a book, a discussion, or something I stumble across in my day. 
  When I’m not chasing that spark, you might find me working on a hands-on project, always with a bit of 
  humor and a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>DThis site is my corner to share what’s on my mind—thoughts, creations, or whatever’s lighting me up lately. 
  I’m here to explore, reflect, and maybe even stir some inspiration. If you’re someone who loves diving into life’s 
  possibilities too, let’s connect—I’d enjoy hearing what’s on your mind!</p>
